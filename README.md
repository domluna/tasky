# tasky

Run tasks on a schedule and be able to see logs and stuff or something like that.

Have a file that has all my tasks, ex. yaml file and how often and/or when to run when, etc.

What's the point?

1. Automate things
2. Funnnnnnnnnnnn
3. Don't want to figure out cron ( maybe I should just do that? )
4. See 2
